    "\n",
    "Soccer is played by 11 players on each side, therefore, the best method for capturing the pattern of teams from optical tracking data seems to use players’ individual attributes. Given the data for every player, we initialize the players to some canonical order and the order remains fixed throughout the match. For $N = 22$ players on the pitch, the data representation at a frame t can be set as $X_t = [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ..., x22, y22]^T$. Directly using players’ individual jersey numbers for the analysis seems to be a good approach. However, it lacks important contextual concepts such as when a substitution occurs, players receive medical treatment outside of the pitch, a player is sent away, or when analyzing different teams (i.e., different jersey numbers or identities). To deal with all these problems and players’ positional interchanges, a role based analysis is conducted to make dynamic representation possible while initializing the players into the order that is based on their roles. This approach allows each player to be assigned to different roles, only role per frame while changing their positions throughout the match. After grouping players to particular roles, we use players’ $(x, y)$ coordinates and speed attributes to generate features, such as average coordinates and the fastest player attributes in the group. Soccer has its own well-established game strategies such as the tendency of teams to keep their formation structure when opposition team owns the ball. To carry out a role assignment, a cumulative average position of a team is calculated at the frames when the rival team has the ball. A cumulative average position is calculated for the window of the previous 15 minutes and updated at each minute. For each frame, player’s average $(x, y)$ positions is scaled  based on the dispersion of the players’ distribution.\n",

Then we set player's location as a ball location. Therefore, we have no information on a significant amount of data frames when the ball passes from one player to another and when game stops. We only going to use data frames when some player has the ball."
